            And I started from the bottom<br>
            Like a snowman—ground-up<br>
            Like round chuck, and still put hands on you<br>
            Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (get it?)<br>
            Sucker free, confidence high<br>
            Such a breeze when I pen rhymes<br>
            I just got that air about me like wind chimes (yeah)<br>
            Another day in the life (uh)<br>
            Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)<br>
            Now my community's gated and I<br>
            Made it and my neighbors say hi (say hi)<br>
            I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now<br>
            Guess it means I'm way in the sky (way in the sky)<br>
            But I still remember the days of<br>
            Minimum wage for general labor<br>
            Welfare recipient since a minor<br>
            Look how government assistance has made ya!<br>
            Adversity, if at first you don't succeed<br>
            Put your temper to more use<br>
            'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse<br>
            That should only give you more fuel<br>
            Show 'em why you're you<br>
            So close, God, it's like I almost got it<br>
            But close only counts in time, bombs and horseshoes<br>
            So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!<br>
            Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick<br>
            That's why they call me firecracker<br>
            I grew up on wick—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse<br>
            I got some important news to report to<br>
            Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite<br>
            Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?<br>
            Do you still believe in me?<br>
            Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?<br>
            I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now<br>
            And walk out, I will never let you live it down<br>
            I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?<br>
            Man, I know sometimes<br>
            These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice<br>
            To me they're just ink blots<br>
            I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise<br>
            So you might wanna think it over twice (yeah)<br>
            When you retards can roll the dice<br>
            But beef will at least cost you your career<br>
            'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced<br>
            But this middle finger's free as a bird<br>
            Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth<br>
            Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned<br>
            How to incorporate a curse<br>
            Point it towards corporate America<br>
            Stick a fork in and turn<br>
            'Cause four-letter words are more better heard<br>
            The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours<br>
            But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it<br>
            I was there consolin' you when no one knew it<br>
            When your situation showed no improvement<br>
            I was that door, you walked over to it<br>
            I'm the light at the end of tunnel<br>
            So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it<br>
            When that tunnel vision is unclear<br>
            Shit becomes too much to bear<br>
            Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"<br>
            When I was havin' trouble with the snare<br>
            I'm that unrealistic prayer answered<br>
            And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh<br>
            When you struggle with despair<br>
            That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair<br>
            Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare<br>
            Do you still believe in me?<br>
            Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?<br>
            I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now<br>
            And walk out, I will never let you live it down<br>
            I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?<br>
            Started from the bottom like a snowman<br>
            Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that<br>
            But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack<br>
            And I know that I always got Proof at my back<br>
            I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact<br>
            My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you<br>
            'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so<br>
            Give me that apron and mo-<br>
            –tivation to go, Hussein with the flow<br>
            Fake fans left you two-faced at the show<br>
            Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul<br>
            Layin' vocals two days in a row<br>
            True statement, hate to go down this road<br>
            But there's only one route to cross this bridge<br>
            So I walk in this bitch with loose change<br>
            'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll<br>
            But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'<br>
            That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?<br>
            Use the tools you're given!<br>
            Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt<br>
            As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?<br>
            I used to play the loser/victim<br>
            'Til I saw the way Proof was driven<br>
            I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet<br>
            And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets<br>
            Fanny packs, hourglasses<br>
            If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste<br>
            Man, in my younger days<br>
            That dream was so much fun to chase<br>
            It's like I'd run in place<br>
            While this shit dangled in front of my face<br>
            But how do you keep up the pace<br>
            And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?<br>
            When that dual exhaust is coolin' off<br>
            'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all<br>
            'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce<br>
            Still you feel the need to go full tilt<br>
            That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill<br>
            When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will<br>
            Do you still believe?<br>
            <br>
